After speaking with many clients over the years about the value that pools can add to a home, buyers tend to fall into three categories:

**1. Buyers that really want a pool.** These buyers could have children or teenagers and want to have a pool for them to use or they simply just like the aesthetics. Whatever the reason, these buyers will pay a little extra for a pool.

**2. Buyers who absolutely don’t want a pool.** This type of buyer may simply not want the hassle of maintaining a pool or they may have young children and are concerned about safety. These buyers won’t pay extra for a pool and may actually not buy the home at all if you have one.

**3. Buyers who don’t care either way.** If the home has a pool, great! If it doesn’t, then that’s fine too. These buyers won’t alter their offers to accommodate a pool’s value.
