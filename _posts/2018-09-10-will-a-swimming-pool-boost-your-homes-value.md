After speaking with many clients over the years about the value that pools can add to one’s home, buyers tend to fall into three categories:

**1. Buyers that really want a pool.** It could be these buyers have teen children who like to have parties; whatever the case, these buyers will pay a little extra for a pool.

**2. Buyers who absolutely don’t want a pool.** This kind of buyer could be retired, or they may simply not want the hassle of maintaining a pool. For them, your home’s price doesn’t matter, since it comes down to whether or not they want that pool. They won’t pay extra for it, and they may not buy the home at all.

**3. Buyers who don’t care either way.** If the home hasa pool, great! If it doesn’t, then that’s fine too. These buyers won’t alter their offers to accommodate a pool’s value.
