*What home design trends are currently hot in our 2019 real estate market? Find out today.*

Design trends change every year, and it’s no different in real estate. But which home designs are en vogue this year? Which ones aren’t? Today I’ll walk you through what’s currently hot in the market—and what’s not.

First, let’s talk about **the design trends from prior decades that have since fallen out of style:**

* From the 70s: Popcorn ceilings, sunken living room conversation pits
* From the 80s: Wet bars (just turn that bar area into a workstation or countertop)
* From the 90s: The unused living room

Now, what’s currently popular in our market? I’ve recently been to a lot of new model homes from different builders, and it seems as though all these builders have gone to the same design shows. The homes may be different in terms of their floor plans, but the style and architecture are very similar.&nbsp;

**Here are the hottest home design trends I’ve seen:**

* Sliding pocket doors that lead from the house into the backyard
* Large kitchen islands that serve as a focal point for the room
* Floating staircases
* Smooth, clean lines
* Wood tile flooring
* Gray and white colors
* Modern/contemporary wallpapers (believe it or not)

If you’re thinking of remodeling your own home and would like to check out some of these model homes to see the popular design trends for yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’ll be happy to help you out.<br>&nbsp;
