As more and more millennials enter the prime home buying age range, here are a few trends from this demographic that are impacting the market in a big way.&nbsp;

First, **millennials tend to be independent when starting their home search.** They prefer to look at and research homes online before contacting an agent or seeing them in person. This means if you’re putting your home on the market, its listing profile needs to be on all the major real estate websites (Realtor.com, Trulia, Zillow, etc.) and you need to provide as much information about it as possible.

Second, **they’re very cost-conscious.** Many of them are buying homes for the first time and using their savings (with perhaps help from their parents) to do so. This means you need to be careful not to overprice your home. It needs to be attractive to first-time homebuyers, and as I’ve already said, these buyers are very independent when it comes to researching a home’s history. They may already know about your home’s price history, what you bought it for, what the neighborhood comps are, etc.&nbsp;

**Many millennials also follow what I call “HGTV culture.”** In other words, they grew up watching HGTV, and for them, that’s their only exposure to real estate. HGTV shows like “Fix or Flop” or “House Hunters” tend to make it seem like it’s normal to buy a house in 100% turnkey condition. Either that, or it’s a “gut job.” As a result, that’s what they sometimes expect.&nbsp;

I’ve shown plenty of houses to millennials. About 10 to 15 years ago, the hottest home design trends included items like dark-wood floors, dark cabinets, and granite countertops. Homes with these features aren’t necessarily “updated” anymore, but they’re still turnkey. More often than not, though, millennials will enter a home with these features and consider it a gut job.&nbsp;

So remember—millennial buyers may not be willing to pay for the upgrades you added to your home a decade or more ago. They might expect everything to be turnkey or want to negotiate the price to redo the whole house. Don’t be offended if they want to make some changes.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, **you need to be aware of the type of buyers coming through your home**—especially if it’s in the lower price ranges here in Orange County. If your home is under $900,000 or $800,000, it might be attractive to millennials.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
