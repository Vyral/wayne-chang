Did you know that filing too many insurance claims on your home could have disastrous consequences for your sale? Today I’d like to share a story that encapsulates this point.&nbsp;

Recently, I was representing a seller whose home was situated in a really nice neighborhood. During escrow, it came to our attention that the buyer’s efforts to obtain an insurance policy on the home were proving unsuccessful. Why? As it turns out, **the seller had filed too many claims on the property over a two- to three-year period.**

Unfortunately, **a lot of homeowners don’t think about the implications that filing claim after claim will have on their future sale.** Consider this alternative: If you’re planning to sell within the next five years, you might want to avoid filing claims for issues that could feasibly be covered out of pocket or are within your deductible.

In this particular case, about a year and a half ago, the homeowner discovered a pinhole leak originating from the master bathroom that was dripping down from the dining room ceiling—a common issue for Orange County residents. Not long after filing an insurance claim to clear up the issue, they filed yet another water-related claim: A leaky sprinkler on the lawn had caused water to seep into the home and did subsequent damage to the home’s drywall and flooring.&nbsp;

As a homeowner, **it’s important to keep in mind that some insurance companies are sensitive when it comes to water damage claims, so if you file two or three claims in a relatively short amount of time, your future buyer will be denied coverage in all likelihood.&nbsp;**

My best advice is to do a cost-benefit analysis before making a claim on your property, especially if you’re selling anytime soon. You might also call your insurance carrier to see if the issue in question merits a claim. And don’t worry—a simple inquiry over the phone won’t result in you receiving a case number or anything.&nbsp;

If you have any questions related to real estate or if there’s a topic you’d like me to cover in the future, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I look forward to hearing from you\!
