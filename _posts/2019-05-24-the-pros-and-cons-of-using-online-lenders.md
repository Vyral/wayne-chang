A lot of people have asked me in the past about online lenders and whether or not they should use one. Today I’m going to talk about the pros, the cons, and some of the finer points of working with an online lender.

**The big advantage of working with an online lender is that the interest rates are generally a little bit lower** than what your local bank or lender is offering. That’s the main pro.

When you do use an online lender, there are also a few risks involved. First, they usually don’t process your loan in the same state that you are buying a home in. Because they are in a different state, sometimes they aren’t familiar with the local requirements you’ll need to satisfy to close your loan. This can drag out your loan approval and closing date.

Another thing is that online lenders tend not to follow the contract and contingency dates very closely. They likely aren't familiar with underwriting rules and many times don’t meet the appraisal, loan contingency, and appraisal deadlines. **This puts your deposit at risk.**

Finally, you are much more likely to run into delayed responses with online lenders. A local lender is usually reachable 24/7 just like me, but a lot of out-of-state lenders only offer you a phone line that you may or may not be able to reach. Not being able to communicate effectively is huge.

If you’re refinancing, using an online lender is totally fine because you don’t have to deal with timelines as you do in a purchase. **What I recommend is that you use a local lender to help you buy your home, then refinance to a lower rate with an online lender after you have the home and timelines aren’t important.**

If you have any other questions for me about online lenders or anything else related to the mortgage world, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
