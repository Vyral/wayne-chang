We’re near the end of June and I wanted to bring you a quick update on the real estate market and how it’s doing. **We’re going to take a look at the latest numbers and compare them to what we saw last year.**

Our inventory is a lot higher than we had last year. We’re currently at about 7,500 homes on the market in Orange County, which is up from the 5,500 we saw at this time last year. **That’s 36% more homes on the market competing against each other and the most inventory we’ve seen in the past six or seven years.**

Even with the increased inventory, homes are still selling quickly if they’re priced well and show well. If it’s not priced well or not in good condition, however, **it will probably sit on the market for quite a while.&nbsp;**

As for pending sales, there are about 2,700 right now. That number remains flat from 2018, but the ratio of homes in escrow vs. homes on the market is down from 49% last year to 36% this year. **That’s a significant drop, and it means that you need to be sure you’re priced right and in good condition before you list your home for sale.**

We aren’t seeing homes gain half a dozen offers in their first weekend like we have over the last few years, but we are seeing homes sell in just a few weeks with one or two offers.&nbsp;

**If you’re a buyer, this is a great time to be in the market because interest rates are super low and inventory is as high as it has been in six or seven years, giving you plenty more options.**

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime about our market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
