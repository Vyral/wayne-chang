Spring has sprung, and that means one thing: It’s time for spring cleaning.&nbsp;

Thankfully, a certain organization guru has appeared on the pop culture scene to make this often-daunting process a little easier. I’m talking, of course, about Marie Kondo.

Using her incredible methods, decluttering your home will become much easier. You might even say it will “spark joy.” If you aren’t familiar with her methods, don’t worry—we’re going to share them with you today, but with a twist.&nbsp;

While Marie Kondo’s method focuses on what makes you happy, we’re going to talk today about decluttering in a way that will make potential buyers happy. There are three key steps you’ll need to follow:

**1. Remove clutter from pathways.** This will ensure that buyers can easily navigate your home during showings. If you’ve got large pieces of furniture that would get in a buyer’s way, it’s best to remove them. The goal is to show off your room’s space, not your belongings.&nbsp;

**2. Clear off all countertops.** Cluttered countertops make any room look smaller and messier. Especially in kitchens and bathrooms, remove everything you can from counters to ensure a better first impression.&nbsp;

**3. Declutter and depersonalize the walls.** Your family photos may be lovely, but buyers want to imagine your property as their future home—not your current one. Excess clutter on the walls (especially when it’s of a personal nature) will make rooms look cramped. It’s best to treat your home as a clean slate. A single piece of large, contemporary artwork will always look better to buyers than a dozen family snapshots.&nbsp;
