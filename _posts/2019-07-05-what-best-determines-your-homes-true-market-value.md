What is the most accurate method for arriving at your home’s true market value?&nbsp;

Before I answer that question, let’s first discuss three common sources homeowners rely on that aren’t always founded on accuracy:&nbsp;

**1\. The appraisal.** The problem here is that appraisers are often limited to market data that’s anywhere from three months to a year old. Data ages fast—especially during a shift where the market is rapidly trending upward or downward. So it goes without saying that old data doesn’t do a good job of gauging your home’s value today.&nbsp;

**2\. Other active listings.** Many homeowners see their neighbor’s listing and wrongly assume they should price theirs in a similar fashion. This can be a problematic approach if that neighbor’s property has sat on the market for an extended period of time.&nbsp;

**3\. The Zestimate.** This is Zillow’s popular home valuation tool. It’s so popular, in fact, that almost every seller I meet is quick to cite their Zestimate when we’re talking about pricing. However, not only has Zillow never set foot in your property, but their national median error rate is around 9%, which could mean your Zestimate is tens of thousands of dollars above or below your home’s true value. For higher-priced homes in Southern California, research has found Zillow’s error rate to be even more inaccurate.&nbsp;

The most accurate way of determining your home’s value is instead through **the sales comparison approach**. We as real estate professionals apply this method by looking at recently sold homes (ideally in the last 30 days), homes in escrow, and possibly a few active listings that bear a similarity to your home.&nbsp;

By taking a careful look at homes that are similar to yours in condition, size, level of upgrades, and so on, we’re able to come up with a much more accurate assessment. My best advice is to work with a highly active, experienced agent who sees around 20 to 30 homes in a given week because they’ll be in a better position to compare your home against similar properties.&nbsp;
