Today we’re going to bust three common myths about selling your house. **Here are the truths behind them:**

**1\. Broker previews are very effective.** Besides public open houses, there are broker caravans where agents can go preview homes. A lot of homeowners think this is a great way to boost their home’s chances of selling quickly and for top dollar, but it’s really not. When you have a broker preview, the most effective agents are already out there working, not at the broker preview. These previews are usually for newer agents or agents who are not doing a lot of business. We want a buyer, not an agent. I might get some flack from other agents for saying this, but in my experience, broker previews are not effective and rarely bring qualified buyers to the table.

**2\. Open houses are not effective.** A lot of sellers are skeptical about holding open houses because they think there will be too much traffic and too many looky-loo buyers. To an extent, I agree. If an open house is done traditionally, it’s not effective. Most agents show up on the day of, put up a few signs, and hang out at the house. Whoever shows up shows up and there typically isn’t a ton of traffic. However, if you do open houses like we do, it can be effective. We advertise them three days in advance, shoot out an email to all the local agents in the area, canvas the neighborhood by door knocking, and put up 35 to 50 signs on the day of the open house to cover all the streets leading to the home. When we do that, we get three times as many buyers at open houses. A much higher percentage of these people came specifically to see this house. A lot of millennial buyers like to be able to come to these open houses by themselves, too.

**3\. Newspaper and magazine ads work great.** I don’t know of anybody who has ever bought a house because they saw a print ad in a magazine or newspaper. A lot of buyers are under the impression that this strategy works, but it really doesn’t. I would rather focus my time on things that are much more effective, such as internet lead generation, direct calling buyers, letting other top agents know about the house, and more. Those strategies are way more effective than print advertising. Don’t waste your time and money on these avenues.

I hope this was helpful to you and these myths are officially busted in your mind. If you have any other questions for me or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
