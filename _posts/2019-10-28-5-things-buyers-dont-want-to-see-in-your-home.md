<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you trying to sell your home? If so, make sure buyers don’t see any of these five things in your listing.</em></p>

Although people’s personal tastes as far as home features go can vastly vary, there are certain universal turn-offs that no buyers will want to see in your home. So, if you’ve got a property you’re trying to sell, make sure it doesn’t have any of these five things:&nbsp;

**1\. Carpeted bathrooms.** If any of the homes in your bathroom have carpet, it’s time to get rid of it. Even inexpensive vinyl tiling is a far superior choice when it comes to bathroom flooring, so fixing this unsightly faux pas doesn’t have to break the bank.&nbsp;

**2\. “Spools.”** For those who are unfamiliar, a “spool” is a small backyard water fixture that isn’t quite a spa but isn’t quite a pool, either. Unlike hot tubs, spools, which are too small for swimming in, simply feel out of place.

**3\. Strange room additions or lofts.** Adding additional space to your home is great, but shoe-horning unnecessary rooms or lofts into places without sufficient room can really hurt the overall flow of your floor plan.&nbsp;

**4\. White-tile countertops.** White tile countertops with visible grout-lines were popular in the 80s and 90s, but many of today’s buyers view them as eyesores. Thankfully, replacing countertops with quartz or granite can be a relatively inexpensive fix.&nbsp;

**5\. Conflicting flooring.** Sometimes homes will have mismatched flooring throughout, which can look somewhat sloppy. When buyers see things like this, their first thought (if they still consider putting in an offer) is often how they can get rid of it.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
