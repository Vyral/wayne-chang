Today we’ll be taking a quick look at how our real estate market is looking this November. It’s been an interesting season so far.

**Our average days on market has been climbing, putting us at 117 days.** When we’re at 60 days on market, it means we’re in a seller’s market. Last year during this time we saw an average of 54 days on market—it was definitely a good time to sell. A 90-day average gives us a balanced market where buyers and sellers have equal power.

A buyer’s market begins at 120 days, and we’re pretty close with our current average of 117. You want to be very careful about pricing if you’re a seller, as buyers now have the luxury of being more aggressive with negotiations.

Our inventory is 47% higher than this time last year—a significant increase. Demand is down 30%, meaning there is plenty for picky buyers to choose from. They’re looking for turnkey homes, and any properties that are below perfect condition or priced incorrectly are going to be left on the market for a long time.

Fortunately, **it seems the inventory level has reached a plateau.** We usually see this in August and September, but it came a little later this year. For sellers, the levels will hopefully begin to decrease soon.
