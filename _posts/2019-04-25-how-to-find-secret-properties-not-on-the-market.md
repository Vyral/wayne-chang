It happens all the time: A property hits the market and instantly gains the attention of five, 10, or 15 competing buyers. It can be very frustrating to vie against other offers in your search for the right home, but now you don’t have to. 

There are many “secret” properties out there right now just waiting for someone like you to come along and make an offer, and there are three ways you can find them:

**1\. Have your agent do some leg work.** A quality agent will be more than happy to make calls and knock on doors in a neighborhood you’re interested in to find out if any of the homeowners there have been thinking of selling.

**2\. Research expired or canceled listings.** Though these properties have been taken off the market, that doesn’t necessarily mean the owner isn’t willing to sell. Taking the time to find out could be well worth it. 

**3\. Ask your agent to use their network.** Any hardworking, experienced agent should have a vast network of local connections that they can leverage to find homes not listed on the open market. By asking your agent to seek out these lesser-known opportunities, you’re giving yourself the chance to buy without the hassle of competition.
