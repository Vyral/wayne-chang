If you’ve ever submitted an offer on a home you loved only to be beaten out by someone offering to pay in cash, you know what a disappointing experience that can be. But it doesn’t have to be that way.&nbsp;

There are five things you can do as a buyer to make your financed offer equal to (or even better than) any cash offer out there:

**1. Get fully pre-approved.** The reason many financed buyers lose against buyers offering cash is that sellers are trying to minimize potential risk. Unless a financed buyer is fully pre-approved, the seller may worry that they won’t be able to afford the home when all is said and done. Getting approved by a lender will put the seller’s mind at ease and will put you on equal footing with any competing cash offers.&nbsp;

**2. Remove the appraisal contingency.** If you submit a down payment that’s greater than 20%, there’s no real reason to retain the appraisal contingency. Better still, after removing this contingency, then your financed offer becomes virtually the same as an offer made in cash.&nbsp;

**3. Reduce the time spent in escrow.** Cash buyers can typically close within 10 to 15 days. If you can close within this same time frame, the seller will be much more likely to choose your offer.&nbsp;

**4. Reduce your contingency time frames.** In California, you’ve got 17 days to review inspection results, go over disclosure statements, etc. Reducing this period down to 10 days or less will make you even more likely to strike a deal with the seller.&nbsp;

**5. Offer a leaseback period to the seller free of charge.** Sometimes, sellers will ask to rent their property back from the buyer after closing while they finish up purchasing their next home. If you can offer to let the seller stay without asking for any payment, however, this is sure to strengthen your chances.&nbsp;
