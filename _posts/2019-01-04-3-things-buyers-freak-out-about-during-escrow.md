**Termites, asbestos, mold:** What do these three things have in common? If a buyer hears any of these words, **they usually freak out!** Fortunately for buyers and sellers alike, it turns out these issues are actually not as big a deal as you’d think. Today we’ll be discussing why buyers don’t need to flip their lid about any of these issues during escrow.

<u><strong>Termites:</strong></u>

Before I got into real estate, I thought termites came in swarms and devoured homes almost instantaneously (thanks to cartoons). In reality, this isn’t the case—they eat your house very slowly. And because California is the perfect environment for these wood-eating fellows, pretty much every home more than 10 years old has termites.&nbsp;

If your home is 10 or more years old and your termite inspector isn’t finding any termites, you probably need a new termite inspector. **Out of over 500 transactions I’ve completed in the last eight or nine years, only two homes were termite free.** Either way, termites are a treatable problem—common techniques include localized poison injections or tenting the house.

<u><strong>Asbestos:</strong></u>

Contrary to popular belief, asbestos is legal to use today. The government created some restrictions in the 1970s to slow down the amount of asbestos being used, but it still exists and is still used. However, most new construction does not use asbestos.

Homes built during or prior to the 1970s usually have asbestos in popcorn ceilings, insulation, and HVAC ducts. Fortunately, **as long as the asbestos is not compromised, its usage in homes is generally safe.** The only way to know if your property has asbestos is to have it tested.

<u><strong>Mold:</strong></u>

People hate to think about mold, but guess what? It’s everywhere! You’re probably breathing in thousands of mold spores every single day—99% of mold is not dangerous. When you test the inside versus the outside for mold counts, the number is most likely the same. The only way to know the specific kind of mold in your home is to have a professional test it.

What about mold coloration? The color doesn’t signify that it’s bad—black, brown, pink, and green are all different colors mold can have during its lifetime. **The black mold that people often worry about is not actually dangerous until it dries up and begins releasing its spores so just make sure you clean it up before then.** When it comes to other molds, it depends on the person; different types have different effects on each individual just like how some people are allergic to certain things while others are not.
