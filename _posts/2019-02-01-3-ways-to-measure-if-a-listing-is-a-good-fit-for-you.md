For today’s message, **I’d like to highlight three very important (but often overlooked) things buyers should consider when buying.** Before that, though, I’d like to make you aware of a special Valentine’s Day gift our team is offering.

If you or someone you know has recently gotten engaged or married, **our team would like to offer you $1,000 toward your closing costs when you purchase a home with us during the month of February.&nbsp;**

Now that we’ve covered that special announcement, let’s move on to the three things buyers should think about before buying:&nbsp;

**1. The nearby neighbors.** The people living in close proximity to your home can make or break the experience of living there.&nbsp;

**2. The neighborhood demographic.** A mismatched neighborhood culture can make for an uncomfortable homeownership experience. Some buyers prefer a neighborhood with plenty of families, while others would prefer to live in an area with no children at all. It’s best.

**3. The neighborhood’s homeowners association.** If the neighborhood is within a homeowners association (or HOA) you need to be aware of what rules, regulations, and fees that would come along with living there. Some HOAs will issue a citation for having a dirty garage window, while others will do virtually nothing to keep a neighborhood in good shape. It’s essential to know what you’re getting yourself into before making the decision to buy.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
