Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, everyone wants a home sale to go through. However, there are common pitfalls that can ruin an escrow and send all parties involved back to square one. **Today we’ll be looking at three areas where things can go wrong:**

**1. The loan.** Most buyers begin the formal loan application process once their offer is accepted. The lender doesn’t have a chance to underwrite the loan before escrow is opened—the process is often started in the middle of escrow and takes 17 to 21 days to complete. **To avoid this, have your lender begin the process before you make an offer.** This way, your loan is already approved. However, be wary of some lenders—major banks can offer low interest rates but give very poor service.

**2. The appraisal.** If you get an offer for more than what your home is worth, there’s a chance it won’t be appraised at the offered price. Let’s say you have a buyer offering $510,000, but the home is appraised at $500,000. Traditionally, the buyer can cancel escrow and walk away. **To avoid this, sellers can put in a term so that appraisal differences are ignored when a buyer agrees to make a purchase.** If the buyer is short on their down payment, they’ll also agree to make up the difference.

**3. Seller disclosures.** As buyers, we may go into escrow and find the seller discloses some big issues—issues that would have prevented us from making an offer in the first place. For example, multiple water leaks would mean costly fixes for the buyer. **To avoid this, ask for disclosures up front if you are wary of a home.** This way, you know everything you need to know before going into escrow. The only new things you’ll find will be during the home inspection.
