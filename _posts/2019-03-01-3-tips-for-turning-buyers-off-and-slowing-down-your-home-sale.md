Here is a quick list of things you should definitely do if you want to sell your home for a bad price and take forever doing it:

**1. Neglect its presentation.**&nbsp;If you want your home to sell slowly and repel plenty of buyers in the process, make sure to keep your home messy. Leave dishes in the sink, have laundry scattered everywhere, leave your kids’ toys out, cook something with a strong smell that permeates the entire house, and have a noisy pet in the home. Most buyers, when they see these things, will spend about 30 seconds in the home before turning around and leaving.

**2. Show the buyers EVERYTHING.** If you really want to turn a buyer off, make sure to greet them at the door and spend 30 to 40 minutes walking them through the entire house, showing them every single feature so they know how it all works. Pressuring your buyers by overloading them with information and being generally invasive of their time and space is as good a way as any to scare them away. Allowing buyers to talk freely amongst themselves and to explore the house at their leisure might encourage them to stay.

**3. Restrict your showings.** By being restrictive about the times that people are allowed to come and view your home, you’re sure to shrink your pool of buyers. Not everyone has the same schedule. Maybe they’ll come back later—though 90% of the time, they don’t.

These tips are a good way for you to ensure that your home doesn’t sell quickly, or for the price you want.

I can show you the correct way to show and price a home so that yours sells for more money, faster.
