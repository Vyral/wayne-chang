When buyers are looking at properties, they tend to focus on two main areas in the house:

**1. Kitchen.** During the holidays and other social events held in the home, everyone gathers in the kitchen. So if you’re thinking about upgrading your home to add value, focus on the kitchen. Make it more inviting and appealing to buyers.

Modern-style kitchens are very popular in the market at the moment. Buyers like to see lighter shades for the cabinets and countertops; white-on-white is definitely en vogue. It’s also okay to add in a few traditional elements as well, but stay away from bullnose, rounded countertops since that has fallen out of fashion.

**2. Master bathroom.** Buyers today like to see upgraded master showers, free-standing tubs, and nice tile flooring. However, if you have carpet in your bathroom, such as around the toilet or tub area, please get that out—it drives buyers (and me) crazy.

Like the kitchen, buyers also prefer white-on-white for bathroom cabinets and countertops. Another hot item for bathrooms is a Euro clear-glass shower stall, and free-standing tubs are usually preferred to jet-tubs.

If you’re going to spend money on upgrades to add value to your home and attract buyers, these are the two rooms you’ll want to focus on.
