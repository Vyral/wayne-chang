Over my career in real estate, I’ve seen a lot of unusual things. To show you just what kinds of things can happen in a transaction, today I want to share the top three craziest experiences I’ve had in the industry.

**Story \#1: Where’s the Rest of the House?**

About eight or nine years ago when I first started my career, I was showing homes in Santa Ana and we saw this really good deal. We thought we should go check it out. When we got to the house and opened the door inside, it looked pretty normal at first. There was a kitchen, some bedrooms, a hallway, etc. But when we walked to the back of the house, we saw that the entire back of the house was missing\! It looked like somebody took a sledgehammer and just knocked out the entire back wall. They had a tarp to extend the roof which was supported by two-by-four wood posts in the backyard. There were tons and tons of chicken feathers around. We just turned around and left.

**Story \#2: ‘Tasteful’ Art Pieces**

About five years ago, I was showing a house in Laguna Niguel. The house looked great inside; the kitchen was beautiful, the wall colors were fantastic, the bathrooms were upgraded, and the flooring was great. We eventually went upstairs to the master bedroom, where there were three very large black-and-white boudoir photos of the wife of the house—fully naked. Mind you, my buyers had two young children who were running around the house, and at one point, they came into the room. We told them to stay out in the hall, and my buyers were freaked out. At the end of the showing, the listing agent called me and asked how the showing went. I told him it went great, but I also suggested that the seller take down those boudoir photos for showings. The agent told me that they had talked to the sellers about it, but they had insisted they were “very tasteful art pieces,” and decided to leave them up. The listing photos of the house that were put online, including the ones featuring the ‘tasteful art pieces’ are now going to be online forever.

**Story \#3: A Halloween Story**

About three years ago, a client called me to help them rent out their property. It was the first time I’d ever talked to the client, and the current tenant was moving out of the house at the time. &nbsp;I met the landlord at the house with the tenant to do a final walk-through, and as we were leaving, the tenant mentioned that they were leaving because the house was haunted. The landlord said that the tenants had been causing trouble and that the ‘haunting’ was just an excuse. The house looked to be in good condition\! Two weeks later, we finally found a tenant to move in. A few months after that, those tenants didn’t want to lease the house anymore, telling the landlord they thought the house was haunted. They’d been hearing footsteps upstairs, furniture had been moving around by itself, and their daughter said she’d been seeing someone upstairs walking around when no one else was home. I thought it must have been mice or rats. The tenants ended up moving out anyway. I went to the house after they left but never saw anything. The landlord hired another tenant to try to rent out the house, and the same thing happened again\! That agent actually quit that listing because of their supernatural experiences.

I hope these stories help get you into the Halloween spirit\! As always, if you ever have any questions about real estate, please reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
