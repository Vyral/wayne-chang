For many people, their home is the most valuable asset they will own in their lifetime. With that being the case, it’s obviously important for this asset to be protected.

A lot of homeowners will simply have their home in their name and their name alone, but this isn’t a particularly secure option. No one wants to consider the worst-case scenario, but homeowners must think about what will happen to their property if they become incapacitated or pass away. If you don’t put a plan in place for what will happen to your home if either of these events transpires, your property will become tied up in probate court.

The best way to avoid this is to create a trust. **Homeowners who don’t have a trust have inadvertently given the state permission to do with their property as they please** should something happen to them. A trust can dictate your wishes regarding a number of issues, including what you would like to happen to your property, how you would like custody of your children to be handled, and more.

To get started in setting up a trust, the first step you must take is to contact an estate planning attorney. Once you have partnered with this professional to develop your trust, you will be able to rest easy knowing that the court would follow your wishes if something were to happen to you. A trust gives you full control of your estate. If you would like us to connect you with a local estate planning attorney so that you can set up a free consultation, we would be happy to do so.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
