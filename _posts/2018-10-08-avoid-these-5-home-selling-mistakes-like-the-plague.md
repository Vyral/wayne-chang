Homeowners—if you want your next home sale to go smoothly, these are the top five mistakes that you need to avoid:

**1. Overpricing your home.** Especially during this time of year, when the market is a little slower, be very careful not to overprice your home, or you risk losing out on a ton of buyers. An inappropriate price tag on your listing can cause buyers to simply pass over your listing. A home priced at or a little under market value will generate a lot more interest, possibly even creating a bidding war. An overpriced home will likely sit on the market for a long time until you undergo rounds of price reductions.

**2. Not prepping.** Many people want to skip the process of decluttering, cleaning, repainting, etc., when it comes time to sell. However, that’s a mistake. To capture the most interest from buyers, you need to take the time to make sure your home is nice and clean. Give the home a fresh coat of paint, make sure your yard is neat, and be sure that all the appliances and systems on the inside are in working order.

**3. Not staging.** A lot of homes already look very nice already and might only require a little bit of staging, but other homes, like those with children and pets, might need a bit more. Buyers tend to purchase with emotions in mind, so staging the home to maximize its appeal is a great idea if you want to sell for the most money possible.

**4. Not accommodating buyers’ schedules.** Sometimes sellers will say that they don’t want to do showings on certain days of the week. When you restrict your schedule that way, it makes it difficult for buyers to view your home, and you’ll miss out on a lot of activity, potentially reducing the amount you’ll get for the house.

**5. Holding onto the original list price.** Many sellers refuse to lower their list price, thinking that by doing so, they'll get a lower sales price in the end. However, that’s not true. You have to react quickly because most homes that sell do so within the first 30 days; if your home sits on the market for longer than that and you haven’t adjusted your price, then it will probably sit on the market for much longer. This will cause you to net a lot less than you might have otherwise.
