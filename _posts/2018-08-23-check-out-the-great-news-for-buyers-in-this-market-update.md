What has been going on in the Orange County real estate market? Today I’ll give you our latest summer update.

**Inventory is about 20% higher than it was last year.** That means there are a lot more homes on the market this year, especially in the luxury price point between $1.2 million and $2 million. Many of those homes are sitting on the market for 90 days, or even as long as six months.

For homes less than $1 million, inventory is much more plentiful. Here, there’s room for negotiation on price and terms, but remember: good homes still move fast. So if you see a good home out there that’s right for you, jump on it. There may be other competing buyers clambering to purchase it out from under you.

The room for negotiation comes from the increase in time that homes spend on the market (due to the increased inventory levels), as well as rising interest rates. Though rates have increased, they’ve tapered off over the last two or three weeks; talk to your lender to see what rates they can get for you.

What does this mean for buyers and sellers? **It means that sellers have got to be very careful not to overprice their homes**; otherwise, you’ll sit on the market for a long time and likely go through a series of price reductions, ultimately landing you with a lower sales price on your home than if you had just priced your home correctly.

For buyers, it means that you’ve got a range of choices to pick from. Because of this, there aren’t as many multiple offer situations, so you’ll have some negotiating power. **Homes that have been on the market for 30 to 45 days are the sweet spot in which you’ll want to negotiate on price.** Last week, I took a buyer out to Orange County and we saw a really nice home that had been on the market for almost 45 days. After negotiating for a couple rounds, we eventually got the house for about $20,000 less than full price. We’re now in the inspection phase, and we hope that everything works out in the end.

If you have any questions or need some advice about how to proceed in the market, reach out to me. I’d be happy to advise you to real estate success.
