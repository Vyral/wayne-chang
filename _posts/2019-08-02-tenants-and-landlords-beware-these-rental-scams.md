In today’s digital age, scams have become increasingly common. Today, I’d like to shed light on one type of scam, in particular, that has been plaguing our real estate market: rental scams.&nbsp;

Anyone can fall victim to these scams if they aren’t careful. In fact, I once received a call from a would-be tenant who was interested in a property of mine that they had seen listed online for $1,500. The catch is that I had actually listed this property at $2,000. When I asked this person where they’d seen the listing, they told me they had found it on Craigslist.

Unfortunately, I had to inform this person they had been the target of a scam. **Scammers will often take legitimate listings, that may or may not be currently available, and place fake advertisements for them on websites like Craigslist**—usually at a vastly diminished price. Then, once they trick people into paying a deposit, they take the money and vanish.&nbsp;

To avoid these kinds of scams, renters are far better of looking to reputable websites like Zillow, Rent.com, HotPads, and Trulia, which actually pull from the MLS.&nbsp;

Another good way to identify scams is if you’ve been asked to write a deposit check out to someone other than the owner.&nbsp;

But what about landlords? **How can those who own rental properties avoid scams?**

For one thing, make sure all rental applications are properly filled out and come along with all the necessary paperwork, including a driver’s license, bank statement copies, and the applicant’s credit score and credit report, to name a few. If the applicant has chosen to communicate with you through their own agent, this agent will typically be the one to gather these documents.&nbsp;

However, things can go awry even when everything appears to be in order. I was once about to take on a tenant whose agent had given me all the necessary documentation, but upon attempting to run their deposit check, it bounced. I then decided to run their credit on my own and came to discover two things: First, their credit was horrible, and second, the tenant was actually a professional scammer.&nbsp;

**This is why it’s always important for landlords to do some due diligence of their own.** Contacting a tenant’s employer, running their credit, and verifying the validity of all provided documents are all good ways to protect yourself against fraud.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
