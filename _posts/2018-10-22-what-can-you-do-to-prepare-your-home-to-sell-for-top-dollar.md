A lot of my clients ask me for advice on how to get their home ready for sale before listing it on the market. Today I’m going to discuss the best way to maximize your home’s value without spending a ton of money.

**When it comes to making upgrades and improvements on your home, I don’t typically recommend them.** If you spend a dollar on improvements, you will only get 50 cents back if you’re lucky. If you’re thinking about remodeling the kitchen or bathrooms, it’s typically not a good idea unless your home is in really bad shape.

If something is damaged beyond repair, whether it’s your flooring or your kitchen cabinets, you should fix it. Otherwise, don’t bother. **A buyer would rather have a reduction on price than have you charge them more after doing the upgrades.**

Another key is decluttering your home. It really helps open up the space and make the buyer feel that the home has more room. If you have extra bulky furniture or cluttered countertops in the kitchen or bathrooms, take that out. **Each of the rooms in your home should function as intended.**

Also, if you have scuff marks on your walls, get that taken care of. A fresh layer of paint won't cost much, but it will make a huge difference for buyers. Any other minor aesthetic issues should be taken care of as well. Make sure your yard is looking good, too.

Don’t make the mistake of making huge, expensive upgrades just to increase the price of your home. **We had a recent client who spent $30,000 on marble floors, only to see them replaced as soon as the new buyer moved in.**

If you have any questions about getting your home ready for sale or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
