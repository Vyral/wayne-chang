There are three things you need to consider when investing in real estate:

**1\. Get your finances together.** Before you do anything, you want to figure out what your finances actually are. Single-family homes, condos, duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes can be purchased through regular residential loans. You’ll need at least 20% down. Properties that have more than four units will typically need 35% to 40% down, since they’re considered commercial loans. You’ll be qualified based on your individual criteria as well as the building itself—its rent, expenses, etc.

**2\. Know the criteria of what you’re looking for.** Be very specific; you need to look at pretty much everything. You need to consider commercial properties, residential properties, land, and much more. If you want a single-family home with three bedrooms, a two-car garage, and nearby grocery stores, you’ll be able to narrow down your search. When you find a home that meets your criteria, you’re ready to pull the trigger immediately.

**3\. There are two types of investing.** You can buy a property, fix it up, and sell it. Or you can buy a property and make money long-term from renting it out. If you’re going to be a landlord, be ready to acquire an understanding of landlord-tenant law. A lot of first-time landlords are unfamiliar with the many laws involved, so it’s important to know what you’ll be dealing with. If you don’t have time to learn all the laws, hire a property management company to deal with it for you.
