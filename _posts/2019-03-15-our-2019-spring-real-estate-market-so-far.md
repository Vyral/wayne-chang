The spring and early summer market are most conducive to sellers’ ability to earn top dollar on their home—there’s no doubt about it. Knowing that, let’s take a look at some indicators of where we’re trending.&nbsp;

Starting at 0:45 in the video, you’ll see a graph that illustrates Orange County’s year-over-year inventory from 2016 to now.

There is one marker that stands out, in particular: In contrast to previous years, 2018 saw inventory levels go up and up and never experience an end-of-year drop-off. This trend carried over into 2019 and inventory has gone from 4,000 listings to 6,000 listings year over year as a result.&nbsp;

As we move further into spring, this means that sellers will face stiff competition. **If you’re planning to sell your home this season, you’d be well-advised to keep your home in tip-top shape and, most importantly, to make sure it’s priced correctly.** The current market will not be as kind to those who overprice as it was last spring when buyers could list at whatever price they desired and multiple-offer situations pervaded the marketplace.&nbsp;

At 2:30 in the video, you’ll see yet another graph that contains projections and past trends for the expected time on market year over year. Along with inventory, the expected market time continued to increase in 2018 and eventually surpassed the 120-day mark. On that count, we picked up where we left off to start the year, but **we’ve seen a surprisingly steep drop in the number of days homes are spending on the market in recent weeks.&nbsp;**

Although the number of active listings on the market remains high, this gives sellers a reason to be optimistic again; **the same buyers that stayed planted on the sidelines at the end of last year are jumping back into the market again.** I’m seeing this in my own business as well. In the last two weeks, I’ve listed four or five homes—all of which went into escrow in the first weekend at or near full price.&nbsp;

It’s clear that we’re moving into a healthy spring market where both buyers and sellers have a lot to gain. &nbsp; &nbsp;
