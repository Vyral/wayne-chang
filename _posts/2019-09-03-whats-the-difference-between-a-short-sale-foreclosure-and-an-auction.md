What’s the difference between a short sale, foreclosure, and an auction?

Let’s start with defining the short sale. **In this case, the owner of the home is still on title,** meaning they still own the property and sign the purchase contract and all other legal documents involved with the home sale. However, the bank has to approve the price and conditions of the sale because the bank is being sold short of the mortgage balance they owe.&nbsp;

To clarify, this doesn’t mean the process is any shorter; it just means the sale price of the home is short of the amount of money the homeowner owes on the property. You can purchase a short-sale house with cash or financing, and your agent can write a regular purchase contract for it with standard legal forms.&nbsp;

**With a foreclosure, the bank owns the property.** The owner is out of the picture, and the bank signs everything, so they’re the ones you negotiate with if you buy a foreclosure home. Your agent can help facilitate the process, but many banks have their own legal forms and contracts, so when that happens, it’s a good idea to have a real estate attorney review them since they can be different than the regular contracts agents are trained on.

Foreclosure homes are usually purchased as is, and as with short-sale homes, you can buy them with cash or financing.

**When it comes to auctions, the bank owns the property** (or sometimes the county if the owner defaulted on their taxes). Auctions are done on the steps of the county courthouse, and agents aren’t involved. Furthermore, they can only be bought with cash, which means buyers of these homes are typically seasoned investors who bring cashier’s checks with them.&nbsp;

There’s no due diligence process during auction purchases, and you can’t back out of the deal after you sign the purchase contract right then and there on the courthouse steps. All of the title encumbrances come with the property, too, which means you’re in charge of clearing them. That’s why it’s important to do your due diligence beforehand when buying auction homes.&nbsp;
